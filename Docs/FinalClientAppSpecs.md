- part of the home screen of the Oura app, see https://zama-ai.slack.com/archives/C07MMES39GC/p1727704721548049:

    - show a Gauge of Burnt Calorie in the day
        - with baseline [just a show]
        - with inactive time [compute with an easy formula]
        - with an activity score [compute with a non-obvious formula]
